# 🔐 Secure Time-Locked Journal CLI

> A secure, offline, encrypted journal system that lets you write now and read later — like a digital time capsule for your thoughts.

## 🤔 The Problem We're Solving

**"How can someone securely record private thoughts or sensitive life logs, knowing they are encrypted, locked until the right time, and totally offline?"**

### 🔍 Problem Breakdown

**1. People want to journal privately**
- Writing in plaintext files or apps like Notion isn't secure
- Even password managers aren't designed for expressive text entries
- Privacy concerns with cloud-based solutions

**2. They want it encrypted + offline**
- No cloud storage dependencies
- No trackers, accounts, or potential data leaks
- Complete control over your data

**3. They want time-lock control**
- "I want to write something now, but not read it until 1 year later"
- Personal time capsule functionality
- Emotional release mechanism without immediate access

**4. They want organization & tags**
- Tag entries with `mood`, `dream`, `goal`, `memory`, etc.
- Easy searching and filtering when entries unlock
- Meaningful categorization of thoughts over time

## 💡 Our Solution

A CLI vault that provides:

- `init` - Create a secure journal vault with encrypted metadata & entries
- `write` - Add entries with optional tags and labels
- `unlock` - Access entries when the time-lock expires

## 🎯 Who Would Use This?

**Privacy-conscious users**
- Journalists and activists who need secure documentation
- Anyone concerned about digital privacy
- People who want guaranteed offline storage

**Self-reflective individuals**
- Those who want to write letters to their future selves
- People processing emotions or major life events
- Anyone interested in tracking personal growth over time

**Professionals**
- Therapists or coaches who encourage emotional processing
- Researchers documenting sensitive findings
- Writers working on confidential projects

## 🚀 Why I Built This

This project started as a fun exploration of cryptography and CLI development, but quickly became something more meaningful. I realized how often we want to capture thoughts in the moment without the immediate ability to overthink or delete them. 

The time-lock feature creates a unique psychological space — you can be completely honest knowing you won't be able to second-guess yourself until later. It's like having a conversation with your future self while giving your present self the freedom to be vulnerable.

Plus, in an age where everything lives in the cloud, there's something refreshing about a tool that's completely offline and under your control.

## ✨ Key Features
